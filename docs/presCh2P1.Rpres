Looking at Data
=============

(1) Put the data into your Global Environment:
```{r}
data(m111survey)
```

(2) View it:
```{r eval=F}
View(m111survey)
```

(3) Learn more about it:
```{r eval=FALSE}
help(m111survey)
?m111survey #same thing, less typing!
```

A Data Frame
===============

Here is part of `m111survey`:
```{r echo=FALSE}
head(m111survey[,c(1,2,4,8,11)])
```
In a data frame:

- rows are *observations* (individuals)
- columns are *variables*

Variable Types
===============

- **Factor** (Categorical)
    - values (*levels*) are not numbers:  "male", "female",...
    - *ordinal factors.* levels come in an order:  "front", "middle", "back", ...
- **Numerical** (Quantitative)
    - *Double* (Continuous):  values are real numbers 4.37,2.58, ...
    - *Integer* (Discrete):  values are whole numbers 1,4,2,2,...
    
The str() Function
============
type:  prompt

```{r}
str(m111survey)
```

Important Guiding Principle
==============
type:  prompt

The choice of tools will depend on the type of variables involved in your *Research Question*.


Some Research Questions
=================

- "Are a majority of students female?"
    - variable:  **sex** (factor)
- "Who is more likely to prefer to sit in the front:  a guy or a gal?"
    - variables:  **sex** (factor) and **seat** (factor)
- "Who drives faster:  students who prefer the front, the middle, or the back?"
    - variables:  **seat** (factor) and and **fastest** (numerical)

Distribution of One Factor Variable
=================
type:  section
id:  OneFactor

[Back to Table of Contents](#/Contents)

One Factor Variable
================

**Research Question**:

- "What percentage of students in the survey are female?"

Variable involved is **sex** (factor).

Numerical Tool:  Tables
===============

Tally the sexes (a table of counts):

```{r}
xtabs(~sex,data=m111survey)
```

Get percentages:

```{r}
rowPerc(xtabs(~sex,data=m111survey))
```

Graphical Tool:  Barchart
====================

```{r}
barchartGC(~sex,data=m111survey,
           type="percent",
           main="Distribution of Sex")
```

Relationship Between Two Factor Variables
=====================
type:  section
id:  TwoFactor

[Back to Table of Contents](#/Contents)



Two Factor Variables
================

**Research Question**:  "Who is more likely to sit in the front:  a guy or a gal?"

- This question is about the *relationship* between two variables.
- Variables involved are:
    - **sex** (factor).  This is the *explanatory* variable.
    - **seat** (factor).  This is the *response* variable.
- The explanatory variable is the variable that:
    - we think might help *cause* the response, or ...
    - that we might intend to use to *predict* the response.
- Often we don't use explanatory/response distinction


Numerical Tool:  Two-Way Tables
=====================

Also called *cross table*, or *contingency table*.

```{r}
xtabs(~sex+seat,data=m111survey)
```

**But**:  counts don't answer Research Question.  (There are more gals than guys in the first place!)

Row Percents
===============

To check for a relationship between two factor variables, see if  *conditional distributions* differ.  For the conditional distribution **seat** given various values of **sex**, compute row percents:

```{r}
sexseat <- xtabs(~sex+seat,data=m111survey)
rowPerc(sexseat)
```

<small>Females are more likely to prefer the front (47.5%, vs. 25.81% for the guys).</small>

Graphical Tool:  Barchart
=======================

```{r eval=FALSE}
barchartGC(~sex+seat,data=m111survey,
           type="percent",
           main="Seating Preference by Sex")
```

Note the "formula-data" input:

- **formula** is ~explanatory+response
- **data** gives the data frame containing the variables

Barchart Output
===============

```{r echo=FALSE}
barchartGC(~sex+seat,data=m111survey,
           type="percent",
           main="Seating Preference by Sex")
```

***

- Females tend to prefer the front more than guys do.
- Guys tend to prefer the back more than gals do.

Distribution of One Numerical Variable
===================
type:  section
id:  OneNumerical

(Numerical Tools)

[Back to Table of Contents](#/Contents)


One Numerical Variable
==============

**Research Question**:  "How fast do GC students drive, when they drive their fastest?"

This question involves one variable:
- **fastest** (numerical)

Describing a Numerical Variable
=================

Describe the distribution's:

- Center (numerical measurements)
- Spread (numerical measurements)
- Shape (graphical tools)

Numerical Measures:  favstats()
===================

```{r eval=F}
favstats(~fastest,data=m111survey)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
favstats(~fastest,data=m111survey)[1:8]
```

Numerical Measures:  favstats()
===================

```{r echo=FALSE}
favstats(~fastest,data=m111survey)[1:8]
```

- **min**: smallest data value
- **Q1**: first quartile
- **median** median of the data
- **Q3**:  third quartile
- **max**: largest data value
- **mean**:  mean of the data
- **sd**:  standard deviation of the data
- **n** sample size

Describing the Center:  The Mean
==============

The mean of the sample data is:

$$\bar{x}=\frac{\sum{x_i}}{n},$$

where:

* $\sum$ denotes summing
* $x_i$ denotes the individual values to be summed
* $n$ denotes the number of values in the list.

Describing the Center:  The Mean
==============

A small example:

```{r}
FakeData <- c(2,4,7,9,10)
mean(FakeData)
```

Using R as a calculator to compute the mean:

```{r}
(2+4+7+9+10)/5
```

Describing the Spread:  the SD
================
Standard deviation (SD) measures how far the typical data value is from the mean of all the data.

$$s = \sqrt{(\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})^2})/(n-1)}.$$

<small>
* Find the mean $\bar{x}$ of the numbers.
* Subtract the mean from each number $x_i$, then square these "deviations".
* Add up the squared deviations.
* Average them (almost!) by dividing the sum by how many there are, MINUS ONE.
* Take the square root of this "almost-average."</small>

Combining Mean and SD
==================

```{r echo=FALSE}
favstats(~fastest,data=m111survey)[6:7]
```

"The typical GC student drives about 105.9 mph, give or take 20.8 mph or so."

(**The SD is a "give-or-take" figure.**)

Computing SD:  Small Example
=================

A small dataset:
```{r}
FakeData <- c(2,4,7,9,10)
FakeData
```

First, get the mean of the data:

```{r}
mean(FakeData)
```

Computing the SD:  Deviations
=============

Subtract mean from each data value, to get the *deviations* from the mean:

```{r echo=FALSE}
deviations <- FakeData-mean(FakeData)
data.frame(x=FakeData,deviations)
```

Squared Deviations
=============

We don't care about "above" or "below", we only care about how far away, so *square* the deviations:

```{r echo=FALSE}
deviations <- FakeData-mean(FakeData)
squared.devs <- deviations^2
data.frame(x=FakeData,deviations,squared.devs)
```

The square is never negative!

"Almost Averaging"
===============

```{r}
(19.36+5.76+0.36+6.76+12.96)/(5-1)
```


The result is called the *sample variance*.

"Make Up" for Squaring
================

To (sort of) make up for squaring the deviations, we now take the *square root* of the variance:
```{r}
sqrt(11.3)
```

The result is the sample standard deviation!

Describing the Center:  The Median
================

```{r}
FakeData <- c(2,4,7,9,10)
median(FakeData)
```

To find the median:

1. sort the data from smallest to largest
2. look in the "middle" of the list:
    - if $n$ is odd, the median is the middle
    - if $n$ is even, median is average of the two closest to the middle

Quantiles
====================

Also called *percentiles*.

```{r}
with(m111survey,
  quantile(fastest,
    probs=c(0.2,0.5,0.8,0.9)))
```

* About 20% of the students drove slower than 90 mph
* About 50% drove slower than 102 mph (median!)
* About 80% drove slower than 120 mph
* About 90% drove slower than 130 mph

Quartiles
=================

```{r}
with(m111survey,
  quantile(fastest,
    probs=c(0.25,0.50,0.75)))
```

* 25th percentile is the *First Quartile* Q1
* 50th percentile is the median
* 75th percentile is the *Third Quartile* Q3

Describing the Spread:  IQR
=======================

The *interquartile range* is

$$IQR=Q3-Q1.$$

The middle 50% of the data lie between Q1 and Q3.

Combining Median and IQR
===================

```{r echo=FALSE}
favstats(~fastest,data=m111survey)[1:5]
```

* "The median fastest speed driven was 102 mph."
* "The IQR range was $119.5-90.5=29$ mph."
* "The middle half of the students drove between 90.5 and 119.5 mph."

Next Topic
========================

Part 2 will begin with tools for describing the *shape* of the distribution of a numerical variable.
