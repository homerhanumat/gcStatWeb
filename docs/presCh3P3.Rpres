The Death Penalty Data
===================

```{r eval=FALSE}
data(deathpen)
View(deathpen)
help(deathpen)
```

For more information:

  >[Michael J. Radelet: "Racial Characteristics and the Imposition of the Death Penalty", *American Sociological Review*, 46 (1981).](http://goo.gl/ECLVa)

Research Question:

  >*Are black defendants more likely than white defendants to receive the death penalty?*
  
Tables of Results
==================

```{r}
DefD <- xtabs(~defrace+death,data=deathpen)
DefD
rowPerc(DefD)
```
Hmm --- whites a bit more likely to get death!

Lurking Variable
==============

There is a third variable:  race of the victim:

```{r}
str(deathpen)
```

If we take it into account, it may alter our interpretation of the results.

Subsetting
============

Let's break the data down by the values of the lurking variable **vicrace**:

```{r}
deathpenWV <- subset(deathpen,
              vicrace=="white")
deathpenBV <- subset(deathpen,
              vicrace=="black")
```

When Victim is White
===================
left:  40%

Two-way table:
```{r}
DefDWV <- xtabs(
  ~defrace+death,
  data=deathpenWV)
DefDWV
```

***

Then row percents:

```{r}
rowPerc(DefDWV)
```

Black defendants are MORE likely to get death penalty!

When Victim is Black
===================
left:  40%

Two-way table:
```{r}
DefDWB <- xtabs(
  ~defrace+death,
  data=deathpenBV)
DefDWB
```

***

Then row percents:

```{r}
rowPerc(DefDWB)
```

Black defendants are MORE likely to get death penalty here, too!

Bizarre!
===============
incremental:  true

* When the victim is white, the black defendant is MORE likely to get the death penalty.
* When the victim is black, the black defendant is MORE likely to get the death penalty.
* But in the combined data, the black defendant is LESS likely to get the death penalty.

Simpson's Paradox
=================
type:  prompt

  >*Simpson's Paradox* occurs when a relationship between variables $X$ and $Y$ reverses its direction when the data are broken down by the values of a third variable $Z$.
  
How Can It Happen?
=================

* Simpson's Paradox is mathematically possible.
* But can we explain in a satisfying way why it occurs, when it occurs?

Stategy to Explain It
====================

* study how $X$ relates to $Z$
* study how *Z* relates to $Y$
* try to synthesize the results of these two studies

Defendant Race and Victim Race
==============
left:  45%

Two-way table:
```{r}
DefVic <- xtabs(
  ~defrace+vicrace,
  data=deathpen)
DefVic
```

***

Then row percents:

```{r}
rowPerc(DefVic)
```

People tend to kill people of their own race.


Victim Race and Outcome
==============
left:  45%

Two-way table:
```{r}
VicDeath <- xtabs(
  ~vicrace+death,
  data=deathpen)
VicDeath
```

***

Then row percents:

```{r}
rowPerc(VicDeath)
```

The (mostly white) juries got really angry when a white person was killed!

Synthesis
=================

  >Regardless of the race of the victim, white defendants are less likely to get the death penalty, but they "hamstring" themselves by killing mostly white victims --- which is what got juries really mad, back in the day!
