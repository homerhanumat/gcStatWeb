Statistical Relationships
=========================
There are 2 main types of relationships between 2 numerical variables.

* **Deterministic** relationships allow you to *exactly* determine the value of one variable from the value of the other.

* **Statistical** relationships allow you to *estimate* the typical value of one variable from the value of the other.  There is variation from the average pattern.

Deterministic Relationships
===========================

Every temperature in $^o F$ has *exactly* one corresponding temperature in $^o C$. 

$$ y=\dfrac{5}{9}(x-32) $$

This is a **deterministic** relationship because there is no variation in the pattern.  

*** 

```{r,echo=FALSE}
fahr=seq(0,100,0.1)
celc=(5/9)*(fahr-32)
xyplot(celc~fahr,xlab="Degrees Fahrenheit", ylab="Degrees Celcius")
```


Statistical Relationships
=========================

We will use three tools to study **statistical** relationships.

* Scatterplots (Part 1)

* Correlation (Part 2)

* Regression Equation  (Part 2)

Idea for Investigation
================
id:  prompt

>**Research Question**:  At Penn State, how is a student's right handspan related to his/her height?

* Question about the *relationship* between two variables.

* Explanatory variable:  **RtSpan** (numerical)

* Response variable:  **Height** (numerical)


Overall Patterns
===========================
A **scatterplot** graphically displays the relationship between 2 numerical variables allowing us to visually identify

* overall patterns,

* directions, 

* strength of association.

***

```{r,echo=FALSE}
xyplot(Height~RtSpan,data=pennstate1,
       xlab="Right Handspan (cm)", ylab="Height (in)", 
       col="blue",pch=19,cex=1.5) 
```

Graphic:  Scatterplots
============

```{r,eval=FALSE}
xyplot(Height~RtSpan,data=pennstate1,
       xlab="Right Handspan (cm)", 
       ylab="Height (in)", 
       col="blue",pch=19)
```

We are using **response~explanatory** as our input.

The Result:  Scatterplot
=============

Each point $(x,y)$ represents one of the students in the survey.

The $x$-coordinate is their right handspan.

The $y$-coordinate is their height.

***

```{r,echo=FALSE}
xyplot(Height~RtSpan,data=pennstate1,
       xlab="Right Handspan (cm)", 
       ylab="Height (in)", 
       col="blue",pch=19,cex=1.5)
```


Graphic:  Parallel Scatterplot
================

> Since males tend to have larger hands **and** be taller than females, perhaps the relationship observed between right handspan and height is simply a result of a student's sex.

We can investigate this using parallel scatterplots.  We will *condition* on the factor variable **sex**.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
xyplot(Height~RtSpan|Sex,data=pennstate1,
       xlab="Right Handspan (cm)", 
       ylab="Height (in)", pch=19)
```

The Result:  Parallel Scatterplot
===========

The relationship observed in the original scatterplot seems to hold separately for both males and females.

***

```{r,echo=FALSE}
xyplot(Height~RtSpan|Sex,data=pennstate1,
       xlab="Right Handspan (cm)", 
       ylab="Height (in)", pch=19,cex=1)
```

Graphic:  Overlayed Scatterplot
================

Keeping the points on the same plot and grouping **sex** by color makes the plot easier to interpret.

To overlay a scatterplot, we make use of the `groups` argument.


```{r,eval=FALSE}
xyplot(Height~RtSpan, 
       groups=Sex, data=pennstate1,
       xlab="Right Handspan (cm)", 
       ylab="Height (in)", pch=19,
       auto.key=TRUE)
```

The Result:  Overlayed Scatterplot
========================
```{r,echo=FALSE}
xyplot(Height~RtSpan, 
       groups=Sex, data=pennstate1,
       xlab="Right Handspan (cm)", 
       ylab="Height (in)", pch=19,cex=1.5,auto.key=TRUE)
```

Direction
=========

If the observed pattern between 2 numerical variables seems to follow a linear trend, we can describe the **direction** as one of the following:

* positive linear association

* negative linear association

* no linear association

Positive Linear Association
=================

High values of one variable tend to accompany high values of the other.

Low values of one variable tend to accompany low values of the other.

***

```{r,echo=FALSE}
meanX=mean(pennstate1$RtSpan,na.rm=TRUE)
meanY=mean(pennstate1$Height,na.rm=TRUE)
xyplot(Height~RtSpan,data=pennstate1,xlab="Right Handspan (cm)", ylab="Height (in)", pch=19,cex=1.5,
       panel=function(x,...) {
             panel.xyplot(x,...)
             panel.abline(v=meanX,...)
             panel.abline(h=meanY,...)
            }) 
```


Negative Linear Association
=================

High values of one variable tend to accompany low values of the other.

Low values of one variable tend to accompany high values of the other.

***

```{r,echo=FALSE}
meanX=mean(m111survey$GPA,na.rm=TRUE)
meanY=mean(m111survey$height,na.rm=TRUE)
xyplot(height~GPA,data=m111survey,xlab="GPA", ylab="Height (in)", pch=19,cex=1.5,
       panel=function(x,...) {
             panel.xyplot(x,...)
             panel.abline(v=meanX,...)
             panel.abline(h=meanY,...)
            })
```


No Linear Association
=================

There is no apparent pattern between the two variables.

***

```{r,echo=FALSE}
meanX=mean(pennstate1$Height,na.rm=TRUE)
meanY=mean(pennstate1$HrsSleep,na.rm=TRUE)
xyplot(HrsSleep~Height,data=pennstate1,xlab="Height (in)", ylab="Hours of Sleep", pch=19,cex=1.5,
        panel=function(x,...) {
             panel.xyplot(x,...)
             panel.abline(v=meanX,...)
             panel.abline(h=meanY,...)
            })
```

Curvilinear Pattern
================

Data with nonlinear association certainly exist.  **Curvilinear** data follows the trend of a curve. 

Let's look at an example of this.  Load and read about the **fuel** dataset.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data(fuel)
View(fuel)
help(fuel)
```

Fuel Data
========================
The data would not be well described by a line.

As speed increases up to about 60 kph, fuel efficiency decreases.

As speed increases up from 60 kph, fuel efficiency increases.

***

```{r,echo=FALSE}
xyplot(efficiency~speed,data=fuel,xlab="Speed (kilometers per hour)",ylab="Efficiency", pch=19,cex=1.5)
```


Next Topic
========================

Part 2 will begin with the second tool that we will use to study statistical relationships - **correlation**.
