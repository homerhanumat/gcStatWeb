The Ledge-Jump Data
===================

```{r eval=FALSE}
data(ledgejump)
View(ledgejump)
help(ledgejump)
```

Research Question:

  >*Does the weather have any effect on crowd behavior?*
  
Tables of Results
==================

```{r}
WeBe <- xtabs(~weather+crowd.behavior,
              data=ledgejump)
WeBe
rowPerc(WeBe)
```
Looks like crowds were nastier in warm weather!

Inferential Question
=================

Is the pattern in the data due to a real association between weather and crowd behavior?

Or did it just occur by chance?

================
incremental:  true

After all, many things can affect crowd behavior:

* how long incident lasts
* number of people in crowd
* personalities of the onlookers who gather to watch
* personality/behavior of would-be jumper

These things vary from one incident to another.  We model them as "chance."

Hypotheses
==================

Null and Alternative hypotheses:

$H_0$:  Weather and crowd behavior are not related.

$H_a$:  Weather and crowd behavior ARE related.

* The Null thinks the relationship in the data occurred by chance.
* The Alternative thinks the relationship in the data is too strong to be explained (reasonably) in terms of chance alone.

What's Expected by the Null
==================

```{r echo=FALSE}
WeBe
```

* Crowd baited in 10 cases
* Crowd was polite in 11 cases
* $\frac{10}{21} \times 100 = 47.6$% baiting
* $\frac{11}{21} \times 100 = 52.4$% polite

What's Expected by the Null
==================
incremental:  true

```{r echo=FALSE}
WeBe
```

* Cool weather 9 times.  Null expects:
    - baiting 47.6% of 9 times = 4.28 times
    - politeness 52.4% of 9 times = 4.72 times
* Warm Weather 12 times.  Null expects:
    - baiting 47.6% of 12 times = 5.71 times
    - politeness 52.4% of 12 times = 6.29 times

Expected Cell Counts
================

So the Null expects a table about like this ...

```{r echo=FALSE}
exp.counts <- function(tab) {
  expected <- rowSums(tab) %*% t(colSums(tab))/sum(tab)
  rownames(expected) <- rownames(tab)
  colnames(expected) <- colnames(tab)
  return(expected)
}
expWeBe <- exp.counts(WeBe)
round(expWeBe,2)
```

... give or take some for chance variation in all of the factors that might affect crowd behavior.

Formula for Expected Counts
====================
type:  prompt
left:  50%

In each cell, the count expected by the Null is:

$$\frac{\text{rowSum} \times \text{colSum}}{\text{Grand Total}}.$$

***

```{r echo=FALSE}
WeBe2 <- rbind(c(2,7),c(8,4))
rownames(WeBe2) <- c("cool","warm")
colnames(WeBe2) <- c("bait","polite")
WeBe2
```

Example:

For cool-baiting cell,

$$\frac{(2+7) \times (2+8)}{21} = 4.29$$

Observed vs. Expected
==================
left:  50%

Observed:
```{r echo=FALSE}
WeBe2
```
Expected By Null:
```{r echo=FALSE}
round(expWeBe,2)
```

***
Observed - Expected:
```{r echo=FALSE}
WeBe2-round(expWeBe,2)
```

The Chi-Square Statistic
==================
type:  prompt

One Number to measure overall difference:

$$\chi^2=\sum_{\text{all cells}} \frac{(\text{Observed}-\text{Expected})^2}{\text{Expected}}.$$

This works out to:

$$\frac{(2-4.29)^2}{4.29}+\frac{(7-4.71)^2}{4.71} \\
+\frac{(8-5.71)^2}{5.71}+\frac{(4-6.29)^2}{6.29} \\
\approx 4.07$$

Our Big Question
=============

* $\chi^2$ statistic is always $\geq 0$
* the bigger it is, the more the data differ from what the Null expects

Our Question is:

>*What's the chance of getting 4.07 or more, if the Null is right?*

This chance is called a *P-value.*

Finding the P-Value
=================

Our strategy is *simulation*:

* repeat the study many times, in a situation where the Null is correct
* compute the $\chi^2$-statistic each time
* keep track of how often it is $\geq 4.07$

The P-value is $\approx$ the proportion of times the simulated $\chi^2$-statistic exceeds 4.07, the statistic we actually got.

ChisqSimSlow()
=================

Here is an app to perform the simulation

```{r eval=FALSE}
require(manipulate)
ChisqSimSlow(~weather+crowd.behavior,
             data=ledgejump,
             effects="fixed")
```

Deciding about the Null
================
type:  prompt

A common convention is:

>* If $P < 0.05$, we reject $H_0$
* If $P \geq 0.05$, we fail to reject $H_0$

General Social Survey, 2002
================

```{reval=FALSE}
data(gss02)
View(gss02)
help(gss02)
```

(More information:  [General Social Survey]( http://www3.norc.org/gss+website/))

Our Research Question:

  >*Is there any association between one's race and whether or not one owns a gun?*

Descriptive Aspect
======================
left:  40%

```{r}
RaceGun <- xtabs(
  ~race+owngun,
    data=gss02
  )
```
***
```{r}
RaceGun
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
rowPerc(RaceGun)
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
rowPerc(RaceGun)[,1:2]
```

Inferential Aspect
================

Null and Alternative hypotheses:

$H_0$:  In the U.S. population, race and gun ownership are not related.

$H_a$:  In the U.S. population, race and gun ownership ARE related.

Try it out:
```{r eval=FALSE}
ChisqSimSlow(~race+owngun,
             data=gss02,effects="random")
```

Cool Facts
===============
type:  prompt

For a two-way table, the "degrees of freedom" ($df$) are:

$$df = (rows -1) \times (columns-1).$$

If the Null is right, then:

* $\chi^2$ should be about $df$,
* give or take $\sqrt{2 \times df}$ or so.

Example
===============

In the GSS 2002 race and gun study,

$$df=(4-1) \times (2-1) = 3,$$

so if the Null is right then:

* $\chi^2$ should be about 3,
* give or take $\sqrt{2 \times 3}=2.45$ or so.

The actual value was $\chi^2=36.98$ --- far above what the Null expects!

The Chi-Square test
=================
type:  section
id:  chisq

[Back to Contents](#/Contents)


ChisqSimSlow is ...
===============

... awfully slow!

(And unless you repeat many, many times, the approximation to the P-value is not so good!)

chisq.testGC()
=============

chisq.testGC() computes chi-square statistic and P-value for you.

We apply it in five steps.

Research Question:

>*Is there any relationhsip, in the Georgetown College population, between sex and seating preference?*

Step One:  Hypotheses
===================


  >$H_0$:  In the GC population, sex and seating preference are not related.

  >$H_a$:  In the GC population, sex and seating preference ARE related.

Steps Two and Three
=============

* Step Two is computation of the $\chi^2$-statistic
* Step Three is the computation of the P-value

Usually these steps happen together:

```{r eval=FALSE}
chisq.testGC(~sex+seat,
            data=m111survey)
```

  >$\chi^2 = 3.73$, and $P=0.155$.

Step Four:  Decision about the Null
==============

  >Since $P=0.155 > 0.05$, we fail to reject $H_0$.

Step Five:  Conclusion
==============

  >This study did not provide strong evidence that sex and seating preference are related, in the Georgetown College population.
  
A well-worded conclusion is:

* non-technical (no "P-value", "$H_0$", etc.)
* says how much evidence the study provides for $H_a$


Simulating P-Values
=================
type:  section
id:  sim

[Back to Contents](#/Contents)

Getting a Warning
===============

```{r eval=FALSE}
chisq.testGC(~weather+crowd.behavior,
             data=ledgejump)
```

You get a warning:

  >"Some expected cell counts are low:  the approximation of the P-value may be unreliable.
  Consider using simulation."
  
This warning occurs when some expected cell counts are less than 5.

Consider using the `simulate.p.value` argument.

Option:  "fixed"
================

In `ledgejump`, the 21 incidents remain the fixed during re-sampling:

* 9 cool-weather
* 12 warm-weather

Only the response (baiting,polite) varied.

For this type of simulation, use:

```{r eval=FALSE}
chisq.testGC(~weather+crowd.behavior,
             data=ledgejump,
             simulate.p.value="fixed",
             B=2500,
             graph=TRUE)
```


Option:  "random"
================

In `m111survey`, the 71 students were a random sample from the GC population.

In re-sampling, both **sex** *and* the response **seat** will vary.

For this type of simulation, use:

```{r eval=FALSE}
chisq.testGC(~sex+seat,
             data=m111survey,
             simulate.p.value="random",
             B=2500,
             graph=TRUE)
```

Option:  TRUE
==============

If you are in doubt, just use:

```{r eval=FALSE}
chisq.testGC(~sex+seat,
             data=m111survey,
             simulate.p.value=TRUE,
             B=2500)
```

R will run a re-sampling routine of its own.
