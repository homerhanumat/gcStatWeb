```

Research Question
======================

>*What is the relationship between sex and how one feels about one's weight?*

Two Aspects
===================

* **Descriptive Aspect**:  Is there a relationship in the sample data?
* **Inferential Aspect**  Does the relationship in the sample (if any) provide strong evidence for a similar relationship in the population from which the sample was drawn?

We will focus first on the descriptive aspect.

Two-Way Table
=================

```{r eval=FALSE}
SexWt <- xtabs(~sex+weight_feel,
               data=m111survey)
SexWt
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
SexWt <- xtabs(~sex+weight_feel,
               data=m111survey)
SexWt2 <- SexWt
colnames(SexWt2) <- c("under","ok","over")
SexWt2
```

* Two dimensions (rows, columns)
* 2 rows x 3 cols = 6 cells

Row and Column Totals
==================

```{r echo=F}
t2 <- cbind(SexWt2,rowSums(SexWt2))
t3 <- rbind(t2,colSums(t2))
rownames(t3) <- c(rownames(SexWt2),"Total")
colnames(t3) <- c(colnames(SexWt2),"Total")
t3
```

The margins describe each factor variable individually.

 A Marginal Distribution
========================

Tally for **sex**:
```{r echo=F}
xtabs(~sex,data=m111survey)
```

Marginal Distribution of **sex** (percents):
```{r echo=FALSE}
Sex2 <- rowPerc(xtabs(~sex,data=m111survey))
names(Sex2) <- c("female","male","")
Sex2[1:2]
```

 A Marginal Distribution
========================

Tally for **weight_feel**:
```{r echo=F}
Wt2 <- xtabs(~weight_feel,data=m111survey)
names(Wt2) <- c("under","ok","over")
Wt2
```

Marginal Distribution of **weight_feel** (percents):
```{r echo=FALSE}
Wt3 <- rowPerc(xtabs(~weight_feel,data=m111survey))
names(Wt3) <- c("under","ok","over","")
Wt3[1:3]
```

Marginal Distributions
=================
type:  alert

>*The marginal distributions don't tell you anything about how the two variables are related!*

Conditional Distributions
===================

```{r eval=FALSE}
rowPerc(SexWt)
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
SexWtrp <- rowPerc(SexWt2)
SexWtrp
```
Each row of this table gives a *conditional* distribution.

Conditional Distributions
===================

The *conditional* distribution of **weight_feel**, given that **sex** is "female".

```{r echo=FALSE}
SexWtrp[1,1:3]
```

The *conditional* distribution of **weight_feel**, given that **sex** is "male".
```{r echo=FALSE}
SexWtrp[2,1:3]
```



Detecting Relationships
=================
type:  section
id:  Detect

Principle For Detection
===========================
type:  prompt

>If the conditional distributions are different, then the two variables are related.

* compare row percents down a single column
* if they differ, the variables are related


Comparison
===================

```{r echo=FALSE}
rowPerc(SexWt2)
```


Look down the "overweight" column:
```{r echo=FALSE}
temp <- matrix(SexWtrp[,3],ncol=1)
rownames(temp) <- c("femal","male")
colnames(temp) <- "over"
temp
```

70% of the females think they are overweight, but only 29% of the males think they are overweight.

Describing Relationships
======================
type:  section
id:  Describe

[Back to Contents](#/Contents)

=================
Generate the two-way table and the row percents:
```{r eval=F}
SexWt <- xtabs(~sex+weight_feel,
          data=m111survey)
SexWt
rowPerc(SexWt)
```


```{r echo=F}
SexWt2
rowPerc(SexWt2)
```

=====================
When you choose a column:

* Focus on a column with a big difference in %'s
* Preferably where percents are based on large counts

```{r echo=F}
SexWt2
rowPerc(SexWt2)
```

A Good Description
====================

>"The females in the sample are more likely than the males to think that they are overweight (70% of females think they are overweight, as compared to only 29% of the males)."

<small></small>

(Always back up your answer with specific, relevant features of the data!)

A Mistaken Description
==================
type:  alert
incremental:  true


```{r echo=F}
rowPerc(SexWt2)
```

>"The females in the sample are more likely to think that they are overweight (70% of females think they are overwieght, only 2.5% think they are underweight)."

[Comparing row percents across a row involves only one conditonal distribution!]

Another Mistake
==============
type:  alert
incremental: true

```{r echo=FALSE}
PlotSprout <- rbind(c(70,30),c(140,60))
rownames(PlotSprout) <- c("Plot.A","Plot.B")
colnames(PlotSprout) <- c("sprouted","not.sprouted")
PlotSprout
rowPerc(PlotSprout)
```

>"Type of plot and sprouting are related:  in both types of plot, a majority of the seeds (70%) sprouted."

[The conditonal distributions are identical, so the variables are not related at all.]
